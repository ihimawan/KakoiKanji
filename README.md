Japanese learning game for Android. The game itself is a bit hard to explain, so here is the storyboard sequence on how the game works:

<p><b>Step 1:</b> You are given an image and the associated English word. You are only given one answer choice, and said answer choice is the correct answer.</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> You are given another image and English word. You are given two answer choices. The answer from the previous step is shown as one of the answer choice. So the answer choice for this step would be the other one. </p>

<p><b>Step 3 & 4:</b> The same process is repeated for these steps.</p>

<p><b>Steps 5 and on:</b> You would be given an English word that you have seen before in the game session, which you should be able to answer through memory OR you would be randomly given either a new English word (one you have never seen before in the game session), which you should be able to answer through the process of elimination.  </p>
